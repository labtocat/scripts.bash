Print in Colors
===================

Want to add some color to your "Terminal life"? :P

Tired of writing in escape codes for all of your

formatting needs?


**Usage:**

<pre>$ ./cprint "Hello World\n" "red"</pre>
<pre>$ ./cprint "Hello World\n" "red,bold"</pre>
<pre>$ ./cprint "Hello World\n" "red,bold,underline,bg_white"</pre>
