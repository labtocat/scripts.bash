Bash Script to power off your display
=========================================

**Last Updated : June, 2011**

This is a simple bash script which will power off your display for a given period of time. So, next time you decide to grab a cup of coffee, try powering off your display for a couple minutes.

I originally wrote this script to fix an issue with my Dell Inspiron's display.

Every now and then, the  display would just black out and the only way to bring it back up was my restarting the display (restarting the PC before I wrote this script)

**Usage**

*Make the script file executable (One time only) using the `chmod` command*

<pre>
chmod a+x ./displayOFF
</pre>

*Now simply run the script with the time as argument*

<pre>
./displayOFF 4
</pre>

*This will power off the display for 4 minutes*
