Bash Scripts
================

This repo is a collection of scripts that I've written

to help me be lazier than I already am.


Most of these scripts work for both Mac and Linux and are

written for Bash

Basic Usage
-------------

**Give Write Permission**

<pre>$ chmod a+x script.file.name</pre>

**Copy to a Directory in your System Path and Use**

<pre>
$ cp /path/to/script/script.file.name /usr/local/bin
$ script.file.name
</pre>

**Or cd to the parent folder and Use**

<pre>
$ cd /path/to/script
$ ./script.file.name
</pre>
